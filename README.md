Ahoy! mateys! :wave:

I'm Craig. A PHP developer working at [Gene Commerce](https://www.gene.co.uk/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/genecommerce)) in [Brighton](https://www.visitbrighton.com/).

I mainly work on Magento projects but also work on Laravel, WordPress and custom PHP projects.

I'm currently trying to improve my skills in unit testing and CI/CD popelines.

I also have an awful :sweat_smile: attention span so I will start learning someonething, then get distracted and start learning something else, including:
- Python,
- React/React Native,
- Vue,
- C/C++ (Arduino/ESP8266/ESP32),
- Java/Kotlin,
- Electronics.
There are probably a lot more... as I say, I get distracted.
